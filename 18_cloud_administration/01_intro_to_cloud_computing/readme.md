# ☁️ Introduction to Cloud Technologies

In this section, we explore the fundamental concept of **Cloud Computing**. As mentioned in the text, the term "cloud" has become an integral part of the vocabulary for every IT professional and tech enthusiast. Even individuals outside the IT industry frequently hear or use this term.

The current technological landscape is evolving rapidly, and **Cloud Computing** stands at the pinnacle of this transformation.

## 📜 1. History and Origins

While "the cloud" feels like a modern buzzword, the text highlights that the specific term "cloud computing" was actually used for the first time back in **1996**. It appeared in a business plan from the computer company **Compaq**.

However, the *concept* behind the cloud is much older than the term itself. It is a computing model that has existed since the early days of technology.

## 🖥️ 2. The Evolution: From Mainframes to the Cloud

To understand the Cloud, we must look at the **1950s Mainframe Model**.

### The Old Model (1950s)

In the early days, organizations used massive **Mainframe Computers**.

* These were centralized, powerful machines.
* Users accessed them through "terminals" (simple screens and keyboards).
* The processing happened on the mainframe, not the user's terminal.

### The Modern Cloud Model

The text explains that modern cloud computing follows a very similar pattern:

* **The Host:** Instead of a mainframe, services are hosted on powerful servers (Data Centers) delivered over the **internet**.
* **The Terminals:** Instead of dumb terminals, we now access these services via desktops, smartphones, tablets, and laptops.

Essentially, the model involves complex, essential technologies running remotely, which users access from anywhere.

## 🐧 3. Why Linux is Essential for the Cloud

You might ask: *"Why is there a chapter on Cloud Computing in a book about Linux Administration?"*

The answer provided in the text is straightforward: **Linux has completely taken over the Cloud.**

Just as Linux dominates the internet and high-performance computing, it has become the backbone of modern cloud infrastructure.

### Key Statistics

* **Supercomputers:** According to the **TOP500** association, **100%** of the world's top 500 supercomputers run on Linux.
* **Public Clouds:** While a cloud *can* run on any operating system, Linux runs on approximately **90%** of the public cloud market.

### The Reason

The text notes that Linux is dominant largely because its **Open Source** nature makes it highly appealing to IT professionals in both the public (government) and private (business) sectors. Therefore, to master the Cloud, one must master Linux.
