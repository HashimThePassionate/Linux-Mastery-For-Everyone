#  **Managing Users and Groups** 📂

Linux is a **multiuser**, **multitasking** operating system. Multiple users can access the system at the same time, sharing resources while the kernel performs tasks for each user independently and concurrently. To keep everyone’s files safe and private, Linux provides robust isolation and security mechanisms that prevent users from accessing or deleting each other’s data.

When many people use the system, **permissions** become critical. Linux permissions revolve around three fundamental actions:

- **Read** (`r`)  
- **Write** (`w`)  
- **Execute** (`x`)  

These determine who can view, modify, or run files and directories.

## 🔐 The Superuser (root)

At the very top sits the **superuser**, commonly known as **root**. This account has unrestricted access to every part of the operating system:

- Create, modify, or delete any user  
- Change system-wide configurations  
- Access or remove any file  

Use the root account with care—its power is absolute!  

## 🛠️ Hands‑On Approach

To truly master Linux administration, theory alone isn’t enough. This section takes you step by step through practical examples, reinforcing each concept with real command‑line exercises. You’ll get your hands  creating, modifying, and deleting users and groups, then setting and verifying permissions on files and directories.
