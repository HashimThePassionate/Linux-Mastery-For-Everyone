# üìÅ **Working with Files and Directories**

This section discusses files, directories, and various useful Bash commands for managing them. You will learn how to use simple commands that can simplify your tasks.

In section 8 and section 9, you will learn how to create shell scripts involving some of the commands in this section. This will further reduce the amount of time you spend performing routine tasks.

## Create, Copy, Remove, and Move Files

This section discusses file-related commands in Bash, such as `touch`, `cp`, and `rm`. These commands enable you to create, copy, and remove files, respectively.

The following subsections illustrate how to use these convenient commands. Except for the section that discusses how to create text files, the other sections pertain to text files as well as binary files.

## üìÇ Working with the `cp` (Copy) Command

You can copy the file `abc` (or any other file) to a new file named `abc2` with this command:

```bash
cp abc abc2
```

### üìú Code Explanation

  * `cp`: This is the "copy" command.
  * `abc`: This is the **source** file (the file you want to copy).
  * `abc2`: This is the **destination** file (the new file that will be created).


## ‚ö†Ô∏è A Critical Warning: Overwriting Files

Be very careful when you use the `cp` command. If the target file (`abc2` in our example) already exists, `cp` will **permanently overwrite its contents** with the contents of the source file, without asking for confirmation.

### practical example (overwriting)

Let's see this in action:

1.  **Create two different files:**
    ```bash
    hashim@Hashim:~$ echo "This is the original File A." > file_A
    hashim@Hashim:~$ echo "This is the original File B." > file_B
    ```
2.  **Check the content of File B:**
    ```bash
    hashim@Hashim:~$ cat file_B
    This is the original File B.
    ```
3.  **Now, copy File A *onto* File B:**
    ```bash
    hashim@Hashim:~$ cp file_A file_B
    ```
4.  **Check the content of File B again:**
    ```bash
    hashim@Hashim:~$ cat file_B
    This is the original File A.
    ```
    The original content of `file_B` is gone and has been replaced by the content of `file_A`.


## üóÇÔ∏è Copying Multiple Files to a Directory

You can also copy one or more files into a directory. The syntax is `cp <source_file_1> <source_file_2> <destination_directory>`.

For example, both of the following commands copy the files `abc` and `abc2` into the `/tmp` directory:

```bash
cp abc abc2 /tmp
```

```bash
cp abc* /tmp
```

### üìú Code Explanation

  * `cp abc abc2 /tmp`: This command explicitly lists each source file (`abc`, `abc2`) and then provides the destination directory (`/tmp`).
  * `cp abc* /tmp`: This command uses a wildcard (`*`). The shell expands `abc*` to match all files *beginning* with `abc` (e.g., `abc` and `abc2`) and then passes that list to `cp`.

## üõ°Ô∏è Preventing Overwrites with `noclobber`

Fortunately, you can prevent an existing file from being overwritten by setting a shell option called `noclobber`.

### practical example (noclobber)

1.  **Enable the `noclobber` option:**

    ```bash
    hashim@Hashim:~$ set -o noclobber
    ```

      * `set -o`: This is the command to set a shell option.
      * `noclobber`: This option prevents output redirection (`>`) and `cp` from overwriting existing files.

2.  **Create our test files:**

    ```bash
    hashim@Hashim:~$ echo "File A" > file_A
    hashim@Hashim:~$ echo "File B" > file_B
    ```

3.  **Now, try to overwrite `file_B`:**

    ```bash
    hashim@Hashim:~$ cp file_A file_B
    bash: file_B: cannot overwrite existing file
    ```

    The shell now blocks the command and gives you an error message, protecting your file.

4.  **To disable `noclobber`, use `+o`:**

    ```bash
    hashim@Hashim:~$ set +o noclobber
    ```


## ‚öôÔ∏è Useful `cp` Switches (Options)

The `cp` command provides several useful switches that enable you to control the set of files that you want to copy:

  * **`-a` (archive):** This is the archive flag. It's a "super-copy" that preserves the entire directory structure, file permissions, timestamps, and ownership. It's the same as using `-dR --preserve=all`.
  * **`-u` (update):** This is the update flag. `cp` will only copy the file if the source file is *newer* than the destination file (or if the destination file doesn't exist).
  * **`-r` or `-R` (recursive):** These are the recursive flags, which are essential for copying directories.


## üå≥ Example: Recursive Copy (`-r`)

The `‚Äìr` option is useful for copying the files and all the sub-directories of one directory to another directory.

For example, the following commands copy the files and sub-directories (if any) from `$HOME/abc` to the directory `$HOME/def`:

### practical example (recursive copy)

1.  **First, create our source and destination directories:**

    ```bash
    hashim@Hashim:~$ mkdir -p $HOME/abc/subdir
    hashim@Hashim:~$ mkdir -p $HOME/def
    ```

      * `mkdir -p`: Creates the directory and any necessary parent directories.

2.  **Create some files inside the source directory `$HOME/abc`:**

    ```bash
    hashim@Hashim:~$ echo "This is file 1" > $HOME/abc/file1.txt
    hashim@Hashim:~$ echo "This is a sub-file" > $HOME/abc/subdir/subfile.txt
    ```

3.  **View the source directory:**

    ```bash
    hashim@Hashim:~$ ls -R $HOME/abc
    /home/hashim/abc:
    file1.txt  subdir

    /home/hashim/abc/subdir:
    subfile.txt
    ```

      * `ls -R`: Lists the contents of the directory *recursively*, showing all sub-folders.

4.  **Now, perform the recursive copy:**

    ```bash
    hashim@Hashim:~$ cd $HOME/abc
    hashim@Hashim:~/abc$ cp -r . ../def
    ```

      * `cd $HOME/abc`: We first change our location *into* the source directory.
      * `cp -r . ../def`: This is the copy command.
          * `-r`: The recursive flag, telling `cp` to copy directories.
          * `.`: This is a shortcut for the **current directory** (`/home/hashim/abc`).
          * `../def`: This is the path to the destination. `..` means "go up one level" (to `/home/hashim`), and then go into the `def` directory.

5.  **Finally, check the destination directory `$HOME/def`:**

    ```bash
    hashim@Hashim:~/abc$ ls -R $HOME/def
    /home/hashim/def:
    file1.txt  subdir

    /home/hashim/def/subdir:
    subfile.txt
    ```

    As you can see, the entire contents of the `abc` directory, including its `subdir` and all files, have been successfully copied into the `def` directory.
