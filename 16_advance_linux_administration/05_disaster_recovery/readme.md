# 🌩️ Planning for Disaster Recovery & Risk Management

Managing risks is a vital asset for every business and individual. For system administrators, this responsibility is immense. Managing risks should be an integral part of a broader **risk management strategy**.

IT footprints within companies have grown exponentially over the last decade. Today, almost every activity—whether in small businesses, large corporations, government agencies, or the health and education sectors—relies on IT operations. Because every activity is unique, it requires a specific type of assessment. However, in information security, risk management has often become a "one-size-fits-all" practice based on checklists.

## 🛡️ A Brief Introduction to Risk Management

**What is risk management?**
In a nutshell, it comprises specific operations set to mitigate any possible threat that could impact the overall continuity of a business. The risk management process is crucial for every IT department.

### 📜 Origins and Standards
Risk management frameworks initially emerged in the United States following the **Federal Information Systems Modernization Act (FISMA)** laws, which began in 2002. During this time, the **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)** started creating new standards and methods for cybersecurity assessments across US government agencies.


Security certifications and compliances are paramount for every Linux distribution provider competing in the corporate and governmental space. Major distributions like **Red Hat**, **SUSE**, and **Canonical** hold certifications from:
* 🇺🇸 **NIST** (USA)
* 🇬🇧 **NCSC** (National Cyber Security Centre - UK)
* 🇷🇺 **FSTEC** (Federal Service for Technic and Export Control - Russia)

### 🏗️ The Risk Management Framework (NIST SP 800-37r2)
According to NIST, the framework consists of seven steps, ranging from preparation to daily monitoring. In summary, the framework is built upon several important branches:

* **📋 Inventory:** A thorough inventory of all on-premises systems and a complete list of software solutions.
* **🏷️ System Categorization:** Assessing the impact level for each data type regarding availability, integrity, and confidentiality.
* **🔒 Security Control:** Detailed procedures regarding the security of hundreds of computer systems (NIST SP 800-53r4).
* **🔍 Risk Assessment:** A series of steps covering threat source identification, vulnerability identification, impact determination, information sharing, risk monitoring, and periodic updates.
* **📝 System Security Plan:** A report based on every security control, detailing how future actions are assessed, implemented, and their effectiveness.
* **✅ Certification, Accreditation, Assessment, & Authorization:** The process of reviewing security assessments, highlighting issues, and detailing effective resolutions in a future plan of action.
* **🛠️ Plan of Action:** A tool used to track security weaknesses and apply the correct response procedures.

## ⚠️ Types of IT Risks

Risks in information technology vary widely, ranging from physical hazards to malicious acts:

* **Hardware Failure:** Equipment breakdown or malfunction.
* **Software Errors:** Bugs, glitches, and compatibility issues.
* **Spam and Viruses:** Malicious software and unwanted communications.
* **Human Error:** Mistakes made by users or administrators.
* **Natural Disasters:** 🔥 Fires, 🌊 floods, 🌍 earthquakes, 🌀 hurricanes, etc.
* **Criminal Activities:** Security breaches, employee dishonesty, corporate espionage, and cybercrime.

## 🔄 The Risk Management Strategy: 5 Distinct Steps

To address these risks effectively, an appropriate management strategy must be implemented. This strategy generally follows five key steps:

### 1. 🕵️ Identifying Risk
Identify possible threats and vulnerabilities that could impact your ongoing IT operations.

### 2. 📊 Analyzing Risk
Decide the magnitude of the risk (how big or small it is) based on thorough studies and data.

### 3. ⚖️ Evaluating Risk
Evaluate the potential impact on operations. The immediate action is to respond based on this impact assessment. This requires real actions to be performed at every level of operations.

### 4. 🛡️ Responding to Risk
Activate your **Disaster Recovery Plans (DRPs)**, combined with strategies for prevention and mitigation.

### 5. 📡 Monitoring and Reviewing Risk
Trigger a drastic monitoring and reviewing strategy. This ensures that all IT teams:
* Know how to respond to the risk.
* Have the necessary tools and abilities to isolate the risk.
* Can enforce and strengthen the company’s infrastructure.

> **Note:** Risk assessment is extremely important to any business and should be taken very seriously by IT management.
