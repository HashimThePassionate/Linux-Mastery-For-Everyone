# üöÄ **Using Scripts to Showcase Interprocess Communication**

Interprocess communication (IPC) was initially introduced in previous section. In this chapter, we will revisit these mechanisms, focusing specifically on how they can be demonstrated using scripts.

## üè≠ The Producer-Consumer Model

To illustrate most of these communication mechanisms, our examples will be structured around a **producer-consumer model**. This model involves two distinct processes:

* **Producer:** This process is responsible for *writing* or generating data.
* **Consumer:** This process *reads* the data written by the producer.

Both processes interact through a shared common interface.

## üíª Implementation Using Bash Scripts

While IPC mechanisms are typically implemented in distributed systems and are built around applications of varying complexity, our examples will use simple Bash scripts to mimic the producer and consumer processes.

* `producer.sh`: This script will represent the producer process.
* `consumer.sh`: This script will represent the consumer process.

We hope that using these simple models provides a reasonable and understandable analogy for how these concepts apply in more complex, real-world applications.

## Topics to be Covered

We will now explore the following IPC mechanisms, which were introduced in Chapter 5 but will now be covered in greater detail:

* üóÑÔ∏è **Shared Storage**
* ‚û°Ô∏è **Named and Unnamed Pipes**
* üîå **Sockets**

# üóÑÔ∏è **Shared Storage**

In its simplest form, the shared storage for an Interprocess Communication (IPC) mechanism can be a basic file saved to the disk.

In this model, the **producer** writes data to this file, while the **consumer** reads from the exact same file. At any given moment, the data feeds for both the producer and consumer are identical. The two processes communicate entirely via this shared storage file.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è The Challenge: Race Conditions

A significant challenge with this simple use case is maintaining the **integrity of read/write operations**. This is due to the risk of **race conditions** occurring between the underlying operations.

To prevent race conditions, the file must be **locked** during write operations. This lock prevents any other read or write actions from overlapping with the current I/O.

To keep our examples straightforward, we will not be resolving this problem. However, we felt it was important to call it out.

## üíª Example: Producer and Consumer Scripts

In our example, the producer will write a new set of data (specifically, 10 random UUID strings) to the storage file every 5 seconds.

### Producer Script (`producer.sh`)

Here are the commands to create the script, make it executable, and view its contents:

```bash
hashim@Hashim:~$ nano producer.sh
hashim@Hashim:~$ chmod u+x producer.sh
hashim@Hashim:~$ cat producer.sh
```

#### Script Content

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# producer.sh
STORAGE_FILE="./storage"

rm -f "${STORAGE_FILE}"

while true
do
    for (( i=1; i<=10; i++ ))
    do
        uid="$(uuidgen)"
        echo "${uid}"
        echo "${uid}" >> "${STORAGE_FILE}"
    done
    sleep 5s
done
```

#### üìú Code Explanation

  * `#!/bin/bash`: This "shebang" line tells the system to execute this script using the Bash shell.
  * `# producer.sh`: This is a comment identifying the script's name.
  * `STORAGE_FILE="./storage"`: This line declares a variable named `STORAGE_FILE` and assigns it the value `./storage`, which is the path to the shared file in the current directory.
  * `rm -f "${STORAGE_FILE}"`: This command forcibly removes (`-f`) the file specified by `${STORAGE_FILE}`. This ensures the script starts with a clean, empty file each time it runs.
  * `while true`: This starts an infinite loop, causing the code within it to run repeatedly.
  * `for (( i=1; i<=10; i++ ))`: This is a C-style `for` loop that will run 10 times (from `i=1` up to `i=10`).
  * `uid="$(uuidgen)"`: This line executes the `uuidgen` command (which generates a unique random ID) and stores its output in a new variable called `uid`.
  * `echo "${uid}"`: This command prints the value of the `uid` variable to the terminal (standard output). This allows you to see the UUIDs as they are generated.
  * `echo "${uid}" >> "${STORAGE_FILE}"`: This command appends (`>>`) the value of the `uid` variable as a new line inside the shared file specified by `${STORAGE_FILE}`.
  * `done`: This marks the end of the `for` loop.
  * `sleep 5s`: After the `for` loop finishes (10 UUIDs are generated), this command pauses the script for 5 seconds.
  * `done`: This marks the end of the `while true` loop, which then repeats, starting the `for` loop again.

### Consumer Script (`consumer.sh`)

Here are the commands to create the script, make it executable, and view its contents:

```bash
hashim@Hashim:~$ nano consumer.sh
hashim@Hashim:~$ chmod u+x consumer.sh
hashim@Hashim:~$ cat consumer.sh
```

#### Script Content

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# consumer.sh
STORAGE_FILE="./storage"

while true
do
    while IFS= read -r line
    do
        echo "${line}"
    done < "${STORAGE_FILE}"
    sleep 1s
done
```

#### üìú Code Explanation

  * `#!/bin/bash`: Specifies that the script should be run using the Bash shell.
  * `# consumer.sh`: A comment identifying this as the consumer script.
  * `STORAGE_FILE="./storage"`: This declares a variable for the shared file, matching the one used in the producer script.
  * `while true`: This starts an infinite outer loop to ensure the consumer runs continuously.
  * `while IFS= read -r line`: This starts an inner loop designed to read a file line by line.
      * `IFS=`: Sets the Internal Field Separator to empty, preventing it from trimming leading or trailing whitespace from the lines.
      * `read -r`: Reads a line of input. The `-r` (raw) option prevents backslashes from being interpreted as escape characters.
      * `line`: The content of each line read from the file is stored in this variable.
  * `done < "${STORAGE_FILE}"`: This signifies the end of the inner `while` loop and, most importantly, redirects (`<`) the content of the file specified by `${STORAGE_FILE}` to be the input for the `while read` loop. **Note:** This loop will read the *entire file* from the beginning.
  * `echo "${line}"`: Inside the inner loop, this prints the content of the `line` variable (which holds one line from the file) to the terminal.
  * `sleep 1s`: After the inner loop has finished reading and printing the entire file, this command pauses the outer loop for 1 second.
  * `done`: This marks the end of the outer `while true` loop. The script then repeats, re-reading the entire `storage` file from the beginning.

### Visual Output

The following screenshot shows the producer and consumer scripts running simultaneously in two separate terminal windows.

As seen in the image, the producer script (left terminal) generates and prints UUIDs. The consumer script (right terminal) reads from the shared file and prints the exact same UUIDs, demonstrating that communication is successful.
