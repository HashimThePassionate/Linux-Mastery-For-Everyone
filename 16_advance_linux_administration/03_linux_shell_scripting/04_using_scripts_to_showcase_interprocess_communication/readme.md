# 🚀 **Using Scripts to Showcase Interprocess Communication**

Interprocess communication (IPC) was initially introduced in previous section. In this chapter, we will revisit these mechanisms, focusing specifically on how they can be demonstrated using scripts.

## 🏭 The Producer-Consumer Model

To illustrate most of these communication mechanisms, our examples will be structured around a **producer-consumer model**. This model involves two distinct processes:

* **Producer:** This process is responsible for *writing* or generating data.
* **Consumer:** This process *reads* the data written by the producer.

Both processes interact through a shared common interface.

## 💻 Implementation Using Bash Scripts

While IPC mechanisms are typically implemented in distributed systems and are built around applications of varying complexity, our examples will use simple Bash scripts to mimic the producer and consumer processes.

* `producer.sh`: This script will represent the producer process.
* `consumer.sh`: This script will represent the consumer process.

We hope that using these simple models provides a reasonable and understandable analogy for how these concepts apply in more complex, real-world applications.

## Topics to be Covered

We will now explore the following IPC mechanisms, which were introduced in Chapter 5 but will now be covered in greater detail:

* 🗄️ **Shared Storage**
* ➡️ **Named and Unnamed Pipes**
* 🔌 **Sockets**
