# **Exploring the Linux Shell** 🚀

Back in `Section, The Linux Shell and Filesystem`, we introduced you to the shell by exploring the available virtual consoles, command types, and the filesystem. This gave you a fair foundation for what we are about to explore in this chapter. 📚

By now, with everything we have been showing you in this book, you are already well-versed in using the command line. You know some of the most common and useful commands available in Linux, as we explored:
* File operations 📂
* Package management 📦
* User and disk management 👤💾
* Network administration 🌐

All this knowledge will eventually be put to use in this chapter, where we will explore **advanced shell features**, **shell variables**, **regular expressions**, and how to take advantage of the powerful **programming and automation features** of the Bash shell. 🛠️

## **Bash Shell Features** 🐚

The shell not only runs commands but also has many more features that make a system administrator’s life more comfortable while at the command line. 😊

Some of these features include the use of **wildcards** and **metacharacters**, **brace expansion**, and **variables**. Apart from these, you will learn about the shell’s `PATH` and **aliases**.

### A Little Bit of History: The POSIX Standard 📜

Before we proceed, let’s dig into a little history about the standards the shell is based on.

Back in the day, when **UNIX** emerged as an operating system, the need for a standard to oversee different variants appeared. Thus, the **Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)** created the **Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)** as a family of different standards that were meant to assure compatibility between operating systems. 🤝

Therefore, **UNIX** and **Linux**, as well as **macOS** (based on Darwin, the kernel of macOS derived from UNIX), **AIX**, **HP-UX**, and **Oracle Solaris**, are **POSIX compliant**.

POSIX has different standards for:
* The C language API
* File format definitions
* Directory structures
* Environment variables definitions
* Locale specifications
* Character sets
* Regular expressions
