## 📌 1. Low-Level vs. High-Level Package Managers 🔧🔍

### 🔹 Overview

* **Low-Level Managers** (`rpm`, `dpkg`):

  * Handle the **backend** operations for package manipulation.
  * **Unpack** package archives (`.rpm`, `.deb`).
  * Execute pre- and post-install scripts.
  * Directly **install/remove** files to/from the filesystem.

* **High-Level Managers** (`yum`, `dnf`, `zypper`, `apt`):

  * Automate **dependency resolution**.
  * **Download** packages/groups from online repositories.
  * Provide **metadata search** capabilities (descriptions, versions, dependencies).
  * Offer intuitive commands (`install`, `remove`, `search`).

> **Why separate?**
> Low-level tools deal directly with package files, whereas high-level tools simplify administration by handling network operations, dependencies, and metadata management.

## 📌 2. Managing DEB Packages with APT 🐧📥

### 🔹 Root Privileges

* Most package-related tasks require **administrator privileges**.
* Execute commands using `sudo` or switch directly to the `root` user.

### 🔹 Common Operations

* **Installation**: Adding new software.
* **Search**: Locating packages in repositories.
* **Download**: Retrieving `.deb` files without immediate installation.
* **Removal**: Uninstalling software, optionally removing configurations.

## 📌 3. Ubuntu & Debian Repositories 🌐📋

### 🔹 Ubuntu Repositories

* **File Location:**

  * `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/ubuntu.sources.list`

* **Default Sources (enabled by default):**

  1. **Main** – Official, free, and supported software.
  2. **Universe** – Community-maintained free software.
  3. **Restricted** – Officially supported proprietary drivers.
  4. **Multiverse** – Non-free software packages.

> **Note**: To disable a source, comment out the relevant line in the above file.

### 🔹 Debian Repositories

* **File Location:**

  * `/etc/apt/sources.list`

* **Repository Sections:**

  * **main** – Fully free software compliant with Debian guidelines.
  * **contrib** – Free-licensed software that relies on non-free packages.
  * **non-free** – Proprietary software not adhering to Debian guidelines.

> **Insight:** Ubuntu and Debian repository files share structure but differ in naming and URLs.

## 📌 4. Essential APT Commands ⚙️📝

> **Note:** Previously `apt-get` and `apt-cache` were used separately. Now, use the unified `apt` command for enhanced user interaction.

### 🔹 Update Package Index

```bash
sudo apt update
```

* Fetches latest package lists from enabled repositories.
* Displays the count of upgradable packages.

### 🔹 View Help & Common Commands

```bash
apt --help
```

* Lists available commands such as `install`, `remove`, `search`, `list`, and `upgrade`.

### 🔹 Search Packages

```bash
apt search <keyword>
```

* Finds packages matching `<keyword>` in their names or descriptions.

### 🔹 Show Package Details

```bash
apt show <package-name>
```

* Provides detailed information including version, dependencies, and description.

## 📌 5. Installing & Removing Packages ➕➖

### 🔹 Installing a Package

```bash
sudo apt install <package-name>
```

* Resolves and installs dependencies automatically.
* **Example:**

  ```bash
  sudo apt install binutils
  ```

  Installs `binutils` and its dependencies.

### 🔹 Removing a Package

* **Keep Configuration Files:**

  ```bash
  sudo apt remove <package-name>
  ```

  * Removes the package, retains configuration files, prompts for confirmation.

* **Remove Configuration Files Completely:**

  ```bash
  sudo apt purge <package-name>
  ```

  * Removes both the package and its configuration files.

* **Alternative Purge Method:**

  ```bash
  sudo apt remove --purge <package-name>
  ```

### 🔹 Cleaning Leftover Files

* Post-removal, some configuration directories might remain.
* Locate leftover directories:

  ```bash
  sudo find / -type d -name "*<package-name>*" 2>/dev/null
  ```
* Remove manually or run `apt purge` again if necessary.

## System Upgrade 🔄🛡️

Keeping your system up-to-date is vital for security, stability, and access to new features. 

## 📌 1. Refresh Package Lists (`apt update`) 📥

```bash
sudo apt update
```

* **What it does**:

  * Contacts each repository listed in `/etc/apt/sources.list*`
  * Downloads the latest **metadata** (package versions, dependencies)
  * Prepares your system to know which packages can be upgraded
* **Importance**:

  * Ensures all available security patches and bugfix releases are visible

## 📌 2. Upgrade Installed Packages (`apt upgrade`) ⬆️

```bash
sudo apt upgrade
```

* **What it does**:

  * Installs **newer versions** of packages already installed
  * Does **not** remove existing packages or install new dependencies
* **Combined Command**:

  ```bash
  sudo apt update; sudo apt upgrade
  ```

  * Runs both commands sequentially for efficiency 🔁

## 📌 3. Clean Up Unneeded Packages (`apt autoremove`) 🧹

After an upgrade, you may see:

> The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required:
> `libfprint-2-tod1 libllvm9`
> Use `sudo apt autoremove` to remove them.

```bash
sudo apt autoremove
```

* **What it does**:

  * Removes unnecessary libraries and packages no longer required
  * Frees disk space and keeps your system tidy

## 📌 4. Full Distribution Upgrade (`dist-upgrade` / `full-upgrade`) 🚀

For upgrading to new Ubuntu/Debian releases (e.g., 20.04 → 22.04):

```bash
sudo apt dist-upgrade
# or equivalently
sudo apt full-upgrade
```

* **What it does**:

  * Upgrades all packages
  * Installs/removes packages to satisfy dependencies
* **Precautions**:

  * **Backup first**: custom configurations and third-party software might break
  * Carefully review prompts before proceeding

# Managing Package Information ℹ️📦

Besides installing/removing, APT allows you to **search**, **inspect**, and **list** packages efficiently.


## 📌 5. Search for Packages (`apt search`) 🔍

```bash
sudo apt search <keyword>
```

* **What it does**:

  * Finds `<keyword>` in package names/descriptions
  * Long list; pipe to `grep` for clarity
* **Example**:

  ```bash
  sudo apt search nmap | grep nmap
  ```

  * **Warning**:

    ```
    WARNING: apt does not have a stable CLI interface. Use with caution in scripts.
    ```

## 📌 6. Legacy Search (`apt-cache search`) 📜

```bash
sudo apt-cache search <keyword>
```

* **Why use it?**

  * No interactive warning
  * Simpler output than `apt search`
* **Example**:

  ```bash
  sudo apt-cache search nmap | grep nmap
  ```

## 📌 7. Show Package Details (`apt show`) 🔎

```bash
apt show <package-name>
```

* **Displays**:

  * Version, priority, section
  * Maintainer, homepage, dependencies
  * Installed/download sizes
* **Example**:

  ```bash
  apt show nmap
  ```

## 📌 8. List Packages (`apt list`) 📋

* **All packages**:

  ```bash
  sudo apt list
  ```

* **Installed packages**:

  ```bash
  sudo apt list --installed
  ```

* **Compare outputs**:

  ```bash
  sudo apt list > all-packages.txt
  sudo apt list --installed > installed-packages.txt
  ls -lh all-packages.txt installed-packages.txt
  ```

  * `all-packages.txt` is significantly larger
  * Use `diff`, `grep`, or `comm` to compare
